        <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Kristina and I'm a 4th year Economics major and Digital Humanities minor (<i>almost done woooop!</i>). Outside of school, I love sourcing vintage clothing, hanging out with my friends, dancing, and driving around in my car to <b>good</b> music. I hope to go into fashion marketing and styling after graduation, as I’ve come to realized that those are the things that fascinate me the most. I am <b>OBSESSED</b> with my cats, and I can’t wait to have my own apartment and build them the coolest cat tower ever. I also love interior design so I am excited to stalk Facebook marketplace until I can curate the perfect assortment of furniture and art for my future apartment. </p>

        <p> My goals for this class are to learn the basics of coding with HTML and gain a strong understanding of how to build my own website. I hope to become a better problem solver and strengthen my communication skills in a work setting. By the end of this course, I would love to code my own site to display all my art projects and photo series. I also hope to break my fear of coding and see it as an art form in and of itself. </p>
